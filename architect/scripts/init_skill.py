## Overview

[TODO: 1-2 sentences explaining what this skill enables]

## Structuring This Skill

[TODO: Choose the structure that best fits this skill's purpose. Common patterns:

**1. Workflow-Based** (best for sequential processes)
- Works well when there are clear step-by-step procedures
- Example: DOCX skill with "Workflow Decision Tree" → "Reading" → "Creating" → "Editing"
- Structure: ## Overview → ## Workflow Decision Tree → ## Step 1 → ## Step 2...

**2. Task-Based** (best for tool collections)
- Works well when the skill offers different operations/capabilities
- Example: PDF skill with "Quick Start" → "Merge PDFs" → "Split PDFs" → "Extract Text"
