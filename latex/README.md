# LaTeX Skill

Skill for compiling LaTeX documents in VS Code with specific formatting.

> **Note:** For tables, always load `tabularx` in the preamble and use only `X` columns for text. Avoid `booktabs` commands inside `tabularx` unless you know they are supported. See SKILL.md for safe examples and best practices.

## Installation

Ensure LaTeX packages are installed via `scripts/env_check_latex.sh`.

## Usage

See SKILL.md for detailed usage.
