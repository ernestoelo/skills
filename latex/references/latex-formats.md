# LaTeX Formatting Guidelines

## Supported Formats
- Academic reports (article class, tables, bibliography)
- Technical informes (with phases, experimental results)

## Templates
Use the templates in assets/ as starting points:
- template-academic.tex: For academic papers with listings, tables
- template-technical.tex: For technical reports with Spanish babel, extensive tables

## Best Practices
- Use xelatex for Unicode support
- Include proper packages for your needs
- Validate with pdflatex before final compilation
