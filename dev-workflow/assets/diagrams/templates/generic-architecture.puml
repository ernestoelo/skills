' Reference imgs/ for simple flows (e.g., gitflow.png for linear processes)
' Reference examples/ for complex architectures (e.g., biomass-web-architecture.png for production systems)
' Always use colored blocks (#LightBlue, etc.), arrows, and brief notes for consistency

' Replace with your components
rectangle "[Component 1]\n(e.g., Repository)" as Comp1 #LightBlue
note right of Comp1 #LightBlue
  Brief description of Component 1.
  Purpose and key features.
end note

rectangle "[Component 2]\n(e.g., Service Layer)" as Comp2 #LightGreen
note right of Comp2 #LightGreen
  Brief description of Component 2.
  Interactions and responsibilities.
end note

rectangle "[Component 3]\n(e.g., Platform)" as Comp3 #LightYellow

  End-user interaction point.
end note

' Customize arrows and labels
Comp1 -[#Gray]-> Comp2 : [static relation]\n(e.g., contains)
Comp2 -[#Blue]-> Comp3 : [deployment/sync]\n(e.g., build script)
Comp3 -[#Red]-> Comp4 : [execution/flow]\n(e.g., runtime call)

note as Legend
  **Legend:**
  - Gray: Static relationships
  - Blue: Deployment/sync flow
  - Green: Reserved
  - Red: Execution/user flow
end note
