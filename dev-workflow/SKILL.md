# Development Workflow Standards

This skill provides the official engineering standards for the organization. Copilot must enforce these patterns to ensure consistency, reproducibility, and maintainability.

## 1. Governance & Authority
These guidelines are **mandatory**.
- All new projects **must** follow the defined structures.
- Code generated by Copilot must adhere to these conventions (e.g., correct branch names, folder structures).
- If a user requests a pattern that violates these standards (e.g., "just install pip packages globally"), Copilot must **politely correct** them and propose the standard approach (`uv`, virtual envs).

## 2. Capability Scaling
- **Low Complexity** (Simple questions): Use the summaries below to answer directly.
- **High Complexity** (Setup, heavy refactoring): **READ the relevant guide file** to get the full context before generating code.

## 3. Core Standards Summary

### Git Workflow
**Source of Truth:** [Git Workflow Guide](./guides/01-git-workflow-development.md)

- **Model:** Gitflow (use `develop` and `main`).
- **Branch Naming:** `type/description-kebab-case`
  - Examples: `feat/user-auth`, `fix/login-crash`, `chore/update-deps`.
- **Allowed Types:** `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `style`, `test`, `chore`, `hotfix`, `perf`, `build`.
- **Process:** Feature branches merge to `develop`. `develop` merges to `main` for releases.

### AI & Python Development
**Source of Truth:** [AI Development Guide](./guides/02-ai-development.md)

- **Package Manager:** **`uv`** (all projects must use `uv`, not raw pip/poetry).
- **Project Structure:** `src/package_name` layout (no flat layouts).
- **Environment:**
  - `uv init --lib <name>`
  - `uv python pin 3.12` (or current standard)
  - `conf.env` for secrets (never `.env` in git).
- **Key Files:** `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, `.python-version`.

## 4. Workflows

### Setup New AI Project
When asked to creating a new Python/AI project:
1. **Read** [AI Development Guide](./guides/02-ai-development.md) for the exact folder structure and `uv` commands.
2. **Execute** the `uv init` and setup commands as defined in the guide.
3. **Ensure** `.gitignore` includes `__pycache__`, `.venv`, and `data/*`.

### Git Management
When asked to create branches or commit code:
1. **Check** the current branch.
2. **Enforce** the naming convention `type/description`.
3. If the user is on `main` and wants to code, **instruct** them to checkout `develop` or a feature branch first.
